![ts](https://flat.badgen.net/badge/Built%20With/TypeScript/blue) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![SASS](https://img.shields.io/badge/SASS-hotpink.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=SASS&logoColor=white)

This is a React project using TypeScript and SCSS for searching through a movie database on IMDB via the omdbapi API.

## For the testing

Open terminal in your downloaded project folder and type:

```console
mv .env.example .env
```

then you need to replace your API key for "api-key" in the .env file:

```console
REACT_APP_API_KEY="api-key"
```

next you can run:

```console
npm install
```

and after installation; run the APP with:

```console
npm start
```

> **Warning**
>
> This project does not contain Redux, there are no code comments yet, and there are still many things to improve.

I wish you the best of luck with testing the app! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="20px">
